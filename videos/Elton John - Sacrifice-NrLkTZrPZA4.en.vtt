00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.733
It's a human sign

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:24.072
When things go wrong

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.327
When the scent of her lingers

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.249
And temptation's strong

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:36.671
Into the boundary

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.634
Of each married man

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.931
Sweet deceit comes callin'

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.894
And negativity lands

00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.150
Cold, cold heart

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:57.697
Hardened by you

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:02.453
Some things lookin' better, baby

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.999
Just passin' through

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:11.339
And it's no sacrifice

00:01:11.882 --> 00:01:14.176
Just a simple word

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:18.807
It's two hearts livin'

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.562
In two separate worlds

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:28.319
But it's no sacrifice

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.824
No sacrifice

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:39.249
It's no sacrifice at all

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:49.887
Mutual misunderstandin'

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:52.182
After the fact

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:57.105
Sensitivity builds a prison

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.901
In the final act

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.864
We lose direction

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.245
No stone unturned

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:13.250
No tears to damn you

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:17.630
When jealousy burns

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.469
Cold, cold heart

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:25.932
Hardened by you

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.022
Some things lookin' better, baby

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:34.526
Just passin' through

00:02:36.362 --> 00:02:39.908
And it's no sacrifice

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.745
Just a simple word

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.959
It's two hearts livin'

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:51.214
In two separate worlds

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:56.763
But it's no sacrifice

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.018
No sacrifice

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:07.610
It's no sacrifice at all

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.016
Cold, cold heart

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.522
Hardened by you

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:42.612
Some things lookin' better, baby

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.116
Just passin' through

00:03:48.077 --> 00:03:51.539
And it's no sacrifice

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:54.335
Just a simple word

00:03:56.504 --> 00:03:58.715
It's two hearts livin'

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.762
In two separate worlds

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.352
But it's no sacrifice

00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:12.816
No sacrifice

00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:19.241
It's no sacrifice at all

00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.584
No sacrifice at all

00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:36.304
No sacrifice at all
